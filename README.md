# DSA_Warshall-s_Algo
Warshall's algorithm is used to determine the transitive closure of a directed graph or all paths in a directed graph by using the adjacency matrix. For this, it generates a sequence of n matrices. Where, n is used to describe the number of vertices. A sequence of vertices is used to define a path in a simple graph.
